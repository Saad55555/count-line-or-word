# count-words

I was given the following task. I provided 2 solutions, one using 'while loop' and the other using 'for loop'.

Question
Write a Python program that reads a series of lines one by one from the keyboard 
(ending by an empty line) and, at the end, outputs the number of times that the 
first line occurred. For example, if it reads

hello
world
We say hello
hello
Birkbeck
hello

it would output 3 since the first line ("hello") occurred three times.

You may assume that the user enters at least two non-empty lines before the empty line.
